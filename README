NAME
    Catalyst::Engine::HTTP::POE - Single-threaded multi-tasking Catalyst
    engine

SYNOPIS
        CATALYST_ENGINE='HTTP::POE' script/yourapp_server.pl

DESCRIPTION
    This engine allows Catalyst to process multiple requests in parallel
    within a single process. Much of the internal Catalyst flow now uses POE
    yield calls. Application code will still block of course, but all I/O,
    header processing, and POST body processing is handled asynchronously.

    A good example of the engine's power is the
    Catalyst::Plugin::UploadProgress demo application, which can process a
    file upload as well as an Ajax polling request at the same time in the
    same process.

    Note that this engine requires at least Catalyst 5.67 (or trunk revision
    3742 or higher).

DEBUGGING
    To enable trace-level debugging, set the environment variable
    CATALYST_POE_DEBUG.

    At any time you can get a dump of the internal state of the engine by
    sending a USR1 signal to the running process.

EXPERIMENTAL STATUS
    This engine should still be considered experimental and likely has bugs,
    however as it's only intended for development, please use it and report
    bugs.

    The engine has been tested with the UploadProgress demo, the Streaming
    example, and one of my own moderately large applications. It also fully
    passes the Catalyst test suite.
